1. React as a Single Page Application (SPA)

React is mainly used to build Single Page Applications (SPA).

In an SPA:
The browser loads only one HTML page (index.html).
Page content changes without reloading the whole page.
This gives faster performance and a smooth user experience.
React updates only the required parts of the page instead of loading new pages every time.

2. Virtual DOM in React

React uses a Virtual DOM, which is a lightweight copy of the real DOM.
When we modify a component, React:
Updates the Virtual DOM
Compares it with the previous version (Diffing)
Updates only the changed parts in the real DOM

Advantages
Faster updates
Better performance
Efficient rendering

3. Components in React

React applications are made of components
Each file we create in React is a component
Components are reusable, independent, and easy to maintain

Example:

Header component
Footer component
Home component

4. Page Navigation: JavaScript vs React

Page Navigation in JavaScript
Uses window.location or links
Full page reload happens
Slower performance
Page Navigation in React
Uses React Router
No page reload
Only components change
Faster and smoother navigation

5. Creating a React Project using Vite

Command
npm create vite@latest project_name

Explanation
npm → Node Package Manager (used to run commands)
create → Keyword to create a project
vite → Build tool for fast development
@latest → Optional, installs latest version
project_name → Name of the project

6. Running a React Project
Command
npm run dev
run → Keyword
dev → Development server in Vite

7. React Folder Structure

Important Files and Folders

node_modules
Contains pre-built libraries and packages

public
Used for static files like images and icons

index.html
Core file
React app runs inside this file
Modified only for SEO optimization

package.json
Meta information of the project
Project name, scripts, dependencies

package-lock.json
Exact dependency versions

vite.config.js
Vite configuration file

eslint.config.js
Code quality and linting rules

.gitignore
Files ignored by Git

8. JSX (JavaScript XML)
JSX allows writing HTML-like code inside JavaScript
Makes UI code easier to understand
File extension: .jsx

Example:

<h1>Hello React</h1>

9. File Connection Flow in React
index.html → main.jsx → App.jsx → Components
Explanation
index.html connects to main.jsx
main.jsx renders App.jsx
App.jsx acts as the entry point
Other components are rendered inside App.jsx

StrictMode
Used during development
Helps detect errors and repetitive tasks
Does not affect production build

10. Component File Structure (JSX)
General structure of a React component:
// import files/packages
import React from 'react';
// function
function Home() {
    return (
        <div>
            <h1>Home Page</h1>
        </div>
    );
}

// export
export default Home;

11. Types of Components in React
1. Functional Components (Most Common)
Written using functions
Simple and easy to use
Uses Hooks
Boilerplate shortcut: rfc

2. Class Components

Written using ES6 classes
Uses lifecycle methods
More complex
Boilerplate shortcut: rcc

Differences
Functional Component	Class Component
Uses functions	Uses classes
Uses Hooks	Uses lifecycle methods
Simple and fast	More complex

Most commonly used	Less commonly used
12. Path Shortcuts
./ → Exit from a file
../ → Exit from a folder

13. Import and Export Rule
Do not mention file extensions while importing
Example:
import Home from "./Home";
✔ Correct

import Home from "./Home.jsx";
❌ Incorrect

1. Difference between ECMAScript (ES) and JavaScript (JS)
ECMAScript (ES)

ECMAScript is a standard

It defines rules, syntax, and features for scripting languages

It does not run by itself

Examples:

ES5, ES6 (2015), ES7, ES8…

JavaScript (JS)

JavaScript is a programming language

It follows ECMAScript rules

It can run in browsers and servers (Node.js)

Used to build web applications

Difference Table
ECMAScript (ES)	JavaScript (JS)
Specification / Standard	Programming Language
Defines syntax & rules	Implements ES rules
Cannot run alone	Runs in browser / server
Updated as ES versions	Uses ES features

Example:
ES6 introduced let, const, arrow functions → JavaScript uses them.

2. Parent Tag Rule in React (JSX)

Inside the return() of a React component:

Only one parent element is allowed

All HTML must be wrapped in a single parent tag

Correct Examples
return (
  <div>
    <h1>Hello</h1>
    <p>Welcome</p>
  </div>
);


OR using Fragment

return (
  <>
    <h1>Hello</h1>
    <p>Welcome</p>
  </>
);

Why this rule?

JSX converts code into JavaScript objects

JavaScript can return only one object

3. Component Naming Rule in React

Component name must start with a capital letter

If written in small letters, React treats it as an HTML tag

Correct
import Home from "./Home";
<Home />

Incorrect
<home />   // React thinks this is an HTML tag

4. Self-Closing Tags in React

Tags without content must be self-closing

Examples
<img />
<input />
<br />
<hr />
<Home />


❌ <img>
✔ <img />

5. Importing and Calling Components in App.jsx
Importing a Component
import Home from "./Home";

Calling a Component
function App() {
  return (
    <>
      <Home />
    </>
  );
}

export default App;

Why App.jsx?

App.jsx is the main container

All components are rendered inside App.jsx

6. Importance of index.html

It is the root HTML file

React app loads inside this file

Contains a <div id="root"></div>

Browser first loads index.html

<div id="root"></div>


React injects UI inside this div

Mostly unchanged (except for SEO)

7. Importance of main.jsx

main.jsx is the starting point of React

It connects:

index.html

App.jsx

Role of main.jsx

Renders the React application

Uses ReactDOM.createRoot

Wraps App inside StrictMode

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root")).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>
);

8. Flow of Execution in React
Browser
   ↓
index.html
   ↓
main.jsx
   ↓
App.jsx
   ↓
Components
 
ES6 features
Arrow function 
variables-- let and const
destructuring -extract from object

difference between public folder and assets folder

flower bracket is used to print javascript value in react components.

props:
relationship between child and parent components
props are case sensitive and it is a javascriptvalue
